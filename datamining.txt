Data Mining Using Twitter
After I had extracted all the twitter handles by scraping as I have shown above, I needed to help NIKE do the following:
MY FIRST ANALYSIS
Analyze each of the government and nongovernment’s influencer’s followers counts, number of likes each of the influencer got, number of retweets, number of people they followed, and number of tweets they shared.
Score each of the influencers and top government officials as follows:
(a.) popularity_score = number of retweets + number of likes
(b.) reach_score = number of followers — number of people they follow
(c.) relevance_score = number of comments + number of mentions in other tweets
MY SECOND ANALYSIS
Extract the top 5 unique hashtags these influencers and government officials used in their top 10 retweets. Group them based on their top 5 hashtags similarities.
Make a bar plot to show the fraction of influencers and top government officials by hashtag.
